Trained as a statistician, I have long standing interest in statistical methodology development for graphical models, either directed graphs, e.g. directed acyclic graphs (DAG) or undirected graphs, e.g. Gaussian graphical models  as they serve a compact and elegant way to decode and visualize complex relations among random variables and thus generate wide applications in many fields, such as social network, biological pathway analysis and Gaussian Copula graphical model in financial market. Most applications center around graphical models. I am also generally interested in developing novel statistical methods(frequentist approach or Bayesian method) driven by problems arising in biostatistics, public health, (epi)genetics and genomics.</span>     


## Graphical models and network analysis

Graphical models have attracted increasing attentions in computer science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. One challenging problem is developing computationally efficient algorithms with nice statistical property to infer graph structure which allows one to identity conditional (in)dependence relations among variables. The computing burden is even more severe for directed graphs as directionality brings complexity in. We are developing novel statistically robust and computationally efficient machine learning algorithms to address these challenges.        </span>

Rare variants (RV) are believed to have large effect size and have the potential to explain missing heritability in human complex traits such as autism.  Rare variant association tests tend to be underpowered due to low allele frequency and simple pooling of variants with heterogeneous effect size, e.g. LoF variants tend to be more deleterious than missense variants. We are developing a  Bayesian framework to boost the statistical power by accounting for heterogeneous effect size in different variant groups defined based on numerous functional annotations, such as Polyphen, CADD score and apply the method to study the genetics of human complex diseases, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Alzheimer's diseases (AD).              </span>
